# Community_Insight_Impact
The Community Vulnerability Index (CVI) is the first public project developed by the non-profit Community Insight and Impact (CII). More information about the research can be found [here](https://github.com/community-insight-impact/covid_community_vulnerability). 

While working as a data science intern for CII, I was responsible for constructing data dictionaries and optimizing the data cleaning process through exploratory data analysis techniques.
